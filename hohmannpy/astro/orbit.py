class Orbit:
    r"""
    Class which contains all the information needed to define an orbit. This includes a variety of orbit determination
    schemes (from state, from orbital elements, Gibb's method, etc;) as well as functions to update all the parameters
    which define an orbit.

    The basic ``__init__()`` creates a :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Orbit` from a Cartesian state. As an alternative to this,
    a variety of alternative instantiations decorated using ``@classmethod`` are available for alternative forms of orbit
    determination. Internally, these all use the input parameters to generate the Cartesian state which is then used to
    call the base ``__init__()``.

    The Cartesian state, as well as orbital elements (including the classical and equinoctial ones), are all stored as
    attributes of this class. The Cartesian state acts as the source of truth for the orbit and is always kept up to
    date. The other attributes are not updated automatically from said state when they are accessed (such as by using
    the ``@property`` decorator). The rationale for this is that when determining an orbit from say classical elements,
    if these elements were then passed into a Keplerian solver it would be expected that they would not change. However,
    if the elements were constantly recomputed from the Cartesian state it would introduce floating-point errors that
    could accumulate over time. Instead, manual update methods of the form ``update_element()`` must be called to force
    a recomputation. These should be used with caution, and ideally only :meth:`~hohmannpy.astro.Orbit.update_classical()`
    and :meth:`~hohmannpy.astro.Orbit.update_equinoctial()` should be called externally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position : np.ndarray
        A (3, ) vector of the satellite's planet-centered inertial position.
    velocity : np.ndarray
        A (3, ) vector of the satellite's velocity.
    grav_param : float
        Constant related to the gravitational field strength of the central body. Defaults to that of the Earth.
    track_equinoctial : bool
        Flag which indicates whether to track the equinoctial elements. By default, only the Cartesian state and the
        classical orbital elements (as well as their degenerate cases) are tracked.
    _default : bool
        "Private" internal flag which indicates whether to compute perform an initial call to ``update_classical()``
        (and possibly ``update_equinoctial``) after instantiation. This is assigned ``True`` for instantiations which
        involve the Cartesian state and ``False`` otherwise to avoid the floating-point errors discussed in the class
        description.

    Attributes
    ----------
    position : np.ndarray
        A (3, ) vector of the satellite's planet-centered inertial position.

        towards the right ascending node.

        location.

        zero.
    argl : float
        (Argument of latitude) Sum of the argument of periapsis and true anomaly, only well-defined when the orbit is
        circular and used in place of the true anomaly to track the satellite.
    true_latitude : float
        Sum of the RAAN, argument of periapsis, and true anomaly, only well-defined when the inclination is zero and the
        orbit is circular and used in place of the true anomaly to track the satellite.

        classical orbital elements (as well as their degenerate cases) are tracked.

        A universal variable implementation of Gauss' method to solving Lambert's problem. Lambert's problem involves
        finding the orbit which corresponds to two position vectors and the time-of-flight between them (whether that
        involves traveling the long or short route between them must be specified by the user).

        To do this, the f and g functions and their derivatives are treated as three equations used to solve for
        three unknowns, in this case the Stumpff parameter, universal variable, and a third term known as the
        Lambert parameter. These roughly translate to the change in eccentric anomaly, semi-major axis, and semi-latus
        rectum. Since these equations are transcendental in the Stumpff parameter, a root-finding method is used to
        solve them in which a value for the Stumpff parameter is guessed, all three equations are solved and then
        these are plugged into Kepler's equation where time is set equal to the time-of-flight. Once the correct value
        of the parameter is found, the f and g functions are constructed and used to solve for the velocity at both
        points.

        Parameters
        ----------
        position1 : np.ndarray
            A (3, ) vector of the satellite's planet-centered inertial position at one of the two sightings.
        position2 : np.ndarray
            A (3, ) vector of the satellite's planet-centered inertial position at one of the two sightings.
        tof : float
            Time-of-flight between the two positions.
        current_position_index : int
            Which position vector the satellite currently is located at. Should be either 1 or 2.
        short_transfer : bool
            Flag which indicates the satellite took the long or short arc between the two positions. Set to true for a
            short transfer arc and false for a long arc transfer.
        prograde : bool
            Flag which indicates whether satellite is in a prograde orbit, determines the sign on Lambert's constant.
            True for prograde orbits and false for retrograde ones.
        fg_constraint : bool
            Flag indicating whether to compute the gdot-series independently (increasing computation time) or to
            instead use the series constraint.
        solver_tol : float
            Tolerance to use when solving Kepler's equation.
        stumpff_tol : float
            Minimum absolute value of the Stumpff parameter before switching to the infinite series definition of the
            Stumpff series.
        stumpff_series_length :
            How many terms to evaluate in the Stumpff series when using their infinite series definitions.
        grav_param: float
            Constant related to the gravitational field strength of the central body. Defaults to that of the Earth.
        track_equinoctial : bool
            Flag which indicates whether to track the equinoctial elements. By default, only the Cartesian state and the
            classical orbital elements (as well as their degenerate cases) are tracked.
