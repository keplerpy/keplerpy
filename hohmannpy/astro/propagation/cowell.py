    r"""
    Simplest non-Keplerian propagate which numerically integrates the equations of motion of a satellite using a
    4th-order Runge-Kutta method. This is known as Cowell's method by astrodynamicists.

    Two things set this apart from Keplerian methods. First, it can handle perturbing forces like
    :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.NonSphericalEarth`. However, in addition the accuracy of the propagation decreases over
    time as opposed to a Keplerian propagator which has a fixed accuracy. To mitigate this decrease the step size.

    step_size : float
        Time interval between propagation steps. If one is not provided by the user it will be set in ``propagate()`` to
        60 :math:`s`.
