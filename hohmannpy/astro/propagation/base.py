class Propagator:
    r"""
    Base class for all orbit propagators.

    This gets passed to :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Mission` and used to simulate spacecrafts' orbits via
    :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Mission` . :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Mission.simulate()`. This class' :meth:`propagate()`
    method is then called to step the orbits through time. On each timestep of this process :meth:`log()` is called to
    store data on each orbit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    step_size : float
        Time interval between propagation steps. If one is not provided by the user it will be set in ``propagate()`` to
        60 :math:`s`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    step_size : float
        Time interval between propagation steps. If one is not provided by the user it will be set in ``propagate()`` to
        60 :math:`s`.
    satellites : dict[str, :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Satellite`]
        Dictionary which hold the orbits to propagate as an attribute named ``orbit`` attached to each satellite.
        Satellites are indexed by their name.
    perturbing_forces : list[:class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Perturbation`]
        Perturbations to add to the mission to increase the fidelity of orbital simulation. Note that if any are added
        a non-Keplerian propagator such as :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.CowellPropagator` must be used.

        r"""
        Simulate one or more satellites' orbits in time.

        This method is designed to support child classes' implementations of it via a call to it using ``super()``.
        It fills in all the attributes that were set to ``None`` when ``__int__()`` was called.

        Parameters
        ----------
