class Mission:
    r"""
    Master class for all orbital simulations.

    Contains the ability to propagate the orbits of a set of :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Satellite` and then render and
    propagate the results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    satellites : list of :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Satellite`
        List of satellites whose orbits the Mission will propagate.
    initial_global_time : time.Time
        The Gregorian date and UT1 time to start the mission at.
    initial_global_time : time.Time
        The Gregorian date and UT1 time to end the mission at.
    loggers : list[:class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Logger`]
        Loggers determine which data to record for each satellite during propagation. To see what data each logger
        records, check the attributes labeled ``..._history`` in their respective documentation. For example,
        :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.StateLogger` records the time, position, and velocity of each ``Satellite``. After
        ``simulate`` has been called, these values can also be accessed as attributes of each ``Satellite``.
    propagator : :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Propagator`
        Propagation technique to use to simulate the orbits of each ``Satellite``.
    perturbing_forces : list[:class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Perturbation`]
        Perturbations to add to the mission to increase the fidelity of orbital simulation. Note that if any are added
        a non-Keplerian propagator such as :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.CowellPropagator` must be used.

    Attributes
    ----------
    satellites : dict[str, :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Satellite`]
        Dictionary of satellites created using the ``name`` parameter of each ``Satellite`` as the key and the object
        itself as the value.
    initial_global_time : time.Time
        The Gregorian date and UT1 time to start the mission at.
    initial_global_time : time.Time
        The Gregorian date and UT1 time to end the mission at.
    propagator : :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Propagator`
        Propagation technique to use to simulate the orbits of each ``Satellite``. If none was passed during
        initialization, it will default to :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.UniversalVariablePropagator` unless any
        ``Perturbation`` in which case a ``CowellPropagator`` will be used.
    perturbing_forces : list[:class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Perturbation`]
        Perturbations to add to the mission to increase the fidelity of orbital simulation. Note that if any are added
        a non-Keplerian propagator such as :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.CowellPropagator` must be used.
