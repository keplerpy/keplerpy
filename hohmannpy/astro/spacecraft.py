class Satellite:
    r"""
    Basic spacecraft whose motion can be simulated using :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Mission`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Unique identifier of the spacecraft. Repeats are not allowed.
    starting_orbit : :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Orbit`
        The orbit the spacecraft is in at the start of the perturbation.
    color: str
        The color of the orbit and spacecraft to display in renderings.
    mass: float
        Mass of the spacecraft in :math:`kg`. Needed for missions where the perturbation
        :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.SolarRadiation` is enabled.
    ballistic_coeff: float
        Dimensionless parameter proportional to the drag effects experienced by a spacecraft. Needed for missions where
        the perturbation :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.AtmosphericDrag` is enabled.
    mean_reflective_area : float
        Average area exposed to solar radiation pressure in :math:`m^2`. Needed for missions where the perturbation
        :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.SolarRadiation` is enabled.
    reflectivity : float
        Dimensionless parameter proportional to how much solar radiation is reflected by the ``mean_reflective_area``.
        0 = transparent, 1 = full absorption, and 2 = full reflection. Needed for missions where the perturbation
        :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.SolarRadiation` is enabled.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Unique identifier of the spacecraft. Repeats are not allowed.
    starting_orbit : :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Orbit`
        The orbit the spacecraft is in at the start of the perturbation.
    orbit : :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Orbit`
        Current orbit of the spacecraft. Starts as a deep copy of the ``starting_orbit`` and then is updated on each
        timestep during propagation.
    loggers: list[:class:`~hohmannpy.astro.Logger`]
        Loggers which record data on each timestep during propagation. This attribute is initially set to ``None`` and
        is filled in by the ``__init__()`` of ``Mission``.
    color: str
        The color of the orbit and spacecraft to display in renderings.
    mass: float
        Mass of the spacecraft in :math:`kg`. Needed for missions where the perturbation
        :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.SolarRadiation` is enabled.
    ballistic_coeff: float
        Dimensionless parameter proportional to the drag effects experienced by a spacecraft. Needed for missions where
        the perturbation :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.AtmosphericDrag` is enabled.
    mean_reflective_area : float
        Average area exposed to solar radiation pressure in :math:`m^2`. Needed for missions where the perturbation
        :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.SolarRadiation` is enabled.
    reflectivity : float
        Dimensionless parameter proportional to how much solar radiation is reflected by the ``mean_reflective_area``.
        0 = transparent, 1 = full absorption, and 2 = full reflection. Needed for missions where the perturbation
        :class:`~hohmannpy.astro.SolarRadiation` is enabled.

    Notes
    -----
    Once a satellite's orbit is propagator, the recorded data (attributes) of any ``Logger`` attached to this satellite
    can be access from the satellite using :meth:`__getattr_()`.
